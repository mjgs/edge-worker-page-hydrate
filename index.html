  <h1></h1>
  <p>This static page is being served by Netlify. Every part of the page is static apart from the contents of the h1 tag. The h1 tag is filled in by a Cloudflare worker that runs as the page is being returned to the end user. The worker fetches some data from a serverless function also running on Netlify, and inserts that data into the page, which is then returned to the user.</p>
